## Introduction

There have been many tools for joint dimensionality reduction (JDR) of multi-omics data, many of which have been benchmarked<sup>1</sup>, however the suitability of various tools seems to be largely dependent on the data and the downstream analysis being performed.

Here we present MARMOT (<u>M</u>odel <u>A</u>nalysis and compa<u>R</u>ison for <u>M</u>ulti-<u>O</u>mics <u>T</u>ools), an R tool for comparing JDR models in different conditions or with different inputs.

## Installation guide
MARMOT is available as a GitHub package and can be installed using `devtools`. 

```
install.packages("devtools") # if not already installed
library(devtools)
install_github("kuijjerlab/MARMOT")
```
